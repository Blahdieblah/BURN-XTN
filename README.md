Invocations callable by project owner or Puzzle master.
All XTN and BURN-XTN trading fees are burned.
if market price < ATH in wavelets, then price growth = remaining trading fees buyback and burn BURN-XTN.
if market price > ATH in wavelets, then pool growth = remaining trading fees buy BURN-XTN and add liquidity to pool.
dApp is triggered every week manually, besides performing the above project actions, it also tracks:
- ATH price in wavelets
- ATH price in centlets
- TVL project in WAVES excluding BURN-XTN
- TVL pool in WAVES excluding BURN-XTN
- Price growth %
- XTN total burned
- BURN-XTN total burned
